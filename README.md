# Water-Alarm

Water Waker is an alarm clock supplemented with a water spraying function to help wake up users. Taking inspiration from the refreshing sensation of splashing water on one's face in the morning, the Water Waker will spray the user's face with a brisk burst of water when the alarm goes off.

The product consists of ESP32 as computing device, a water pump attached to servo as electro-mechanical properties, mini water tank, LCD 1602a as a time indicator and buzzer/beeper as audio device.
